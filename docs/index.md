The goal of this documentation is to comprehensively explain the phant API,
both from a reference as well as a conceptual point of view.  If your goal
is to learn how to interact with [data.sparkfun.com](http://data.sparkfun.com),
then most likely you will only be interested in the `management`, `input`, and `output`
sections of this documentation. If you are a [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
developer and would like to contribute to phant, you should check out the [API docs](/api).

## Support
Phant is the open source software behind [data.sparkfun.com](https://data.sparkfun.com),
and it is actively maintained by [SparkFun Electronics](https://sparkfun.com). If
you have questions or feedback about phant, you can contact the team at `data@sparkfun.com`.

If you are having issues with phant, or find errors in the documentation, please
[submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sparkfun/phant/issues).
