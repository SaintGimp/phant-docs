Phant is a modular [node.js](http://nodejs.org) based data logging tool for collecting data from
the [Internet of Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).  It is the open source software that powers
[data.sparkfun.com](http://data.sparkfun.com), and is actively maintained by [SparkFun Electronics](https://sparkfun.com).


Phant is short for *elephant*.  Elephants are known for their remarkable recall ability,
so it seemed appropriate to name a data logging project in honor of a animal that [never forgets](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elephants-never-forget/).
